# Test Plan

**Team 7**:

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

#### Unit-testing strategies
We will be doing manual unit testing. We will test all the functions our selves, to make sure it matches what we want.

#### Integration-testing strategies
Our Q/A tester will go over the app, report in bugs.

#### System-testing strategies
Our Q/A tester will test our app with multiple devices.

#### Regression-testing strategies
When new methods are introduced we will manually test them and see if they reach our requirements.

### 1.2 Test Selection

#### We will choose the Black-box testing since it could be done without understanding the source code. The techniques we will be using are:

1. *Decision Table Testing* used to test system behavior for different input combinations. For example, if we want to verify app can be open or not, we will have condition of *app is install* and *app can be open*, the T & T condition will have the homepage be displayed as an action, while the other 3 condition will have homepage not displayed as an action. It could be used on almost all of the test cases.
2. *Boundary Value Analysis* used to find the errors at boundaries of input domain rather than finding those errors in the center of input. For example, when we change the quantity of items, since the min value for a quantity will be 0, so we enter a -1 and 0 to see if the program will accept the quantity as -1 or not. Same as when the quantity is 0. 

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The quality of our test cases will be assess by using a combination of functional coverage to ensure that the behavior of our program meets the requirement specification, and structural coverage (code coverage) to measure the quality of testing/verification and completeness.

Our choice of code coverage will be decision coverage (branch coverage), which is a testing method that aims to ensure every possible branch from each decision point is executed at least once and thereby ensuring that all reachable code is executed.

We will also be using condition coverage to decision coverage but has better sensitivity to the control flow.

The testing techniques used will differ at each level. Unit testing will use white-box technique to test the internal structure of the application, while integration, system, and acceptance testing will use black-box technique to test the functionality of the application.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
Inside the app there will be section to report bug.

### 1.5 Technology

#### We intend to build and use the following technologies for testing: 

We will do manual testing since it is a small simple app.
